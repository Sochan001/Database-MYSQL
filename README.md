Database Normalization (1NF-3NF)
A demonstraion of database normalization from UNF to 3NF is shown by inserting data of some students of a university. This project simulates real-world database normalization using MYSQL in docker. We have implemented the schema using SQL DDL commands and also verified normalization by reconstructing the original data using JOIN queries.

Overview
This project demonstrates"
1. Database Normalizatiion
2. Docker Deployment

Learning Objectives
• Identify functional dependencies from an unnormalized dataset
• Convert data into 1NF, 2NF, and 3NF
• Design a correct relational schema
• Implement the schema using SQL DDL commands• Verify normalization by reconstructing the original data using JOIN queries
